# wikipedia_viewer

Playing around with the Wikipedia/[MediaWiki action API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page), with some DOM and object manipulation. I tried to use jQuery to optimize the UX which, to me, means as little clicking as possible. 

### What It Does
It's a pretty and quick way to search for Wikipedia articles. It takes your search term, talks to the API, organizes and parses the response, and displays little snippets to the screen. If you want to read more, the link is also inserted into the headings of each returned article, so you can click onward.
